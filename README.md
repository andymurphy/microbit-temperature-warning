# microbit-temperature-warning
A program to make the BBC micro:bit act as a temperature warning device - aimed at KS2.

The hex file can be copied straight onto the micro:bit when it is connected to the PC.
It can also be dragged onto the JavaScript Blocks editor and the editor will convert it into a blocks project.

The js file can be loaded into the JavaScript editor.

I thin both will work this way with the Windows 10 app but I need to check this.
